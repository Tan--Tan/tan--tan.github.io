    Roadmap and project prioritization are fundamental stages in IT development. Which innovations are introduced 
    first determines the attractiveness of the product for customers and their competitiveness.
</p>
<p>
    Often teams get lost when it comes time to select the most impactful idea, especially when the planning horizon is longer than 3 
    months and the product has not yet taken a strong shape or has found market fit. And while the main burden of 
    decision-making lies with the product team, engineers can also contribute to planning to make it more 
    predictable and efficient.
</p>
<p>
    One of the best tricks I've been using in my practice is preparing a one-pager for a project idea or feature. 
    The idea of creating a one-pages appeared in a business context when companies tried to present their business 
    proposal in a sharp and focused way, usually trying to fit everything on an A4 page. In engineering, the same 
    approach applies: in a short document, state the key values of the idea that will achieve the company's goals.
</p>
<p>
    The one-pager should be done after you have decided on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" target="_blank">OKRs</a> for your team or organisation and already 
    collected ideas in the longlist.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <b class="alert-heading">Red flag</b><br/>
    if you first define projects and then tailor OKRs to them you run the risk of missing out on market expectations, falling behind competitors, and in the worst case, losing customers. 
    Without mature engineering processes, roadmapping will be inefficient as you will have to take on unplanned 
    projects without being able to prepare a good system design and thereby increasing tech debt.
</p>

<p>
    One-pager is not expected to provide deep edge case analysis or detailed system design, so preparing and 
    writing it shouldn't take much time. For example, my team set a limit of 3 days for cross-team projects in 
    order to have time to discuss details with developers from other teams. A good one-pager only contains the 
    sections that play a key role in making a go/no-go decision. I use a simple template that is easy to apply 
    both to product and purely technical improvements (e.g. configuring monitoring for legacy systems).
</p>
<p class="font-italic">
    <b>Bonus:</b> The <a href="#">template</a> of the one-pager we’re going to discuss is available in <a href="/assets/others/one-pager/[Template] 1-pager.docx" target="_blank">.docx</a> and .md formats 
    so you can apply it to your ideas immediately. 
</p>
<h2>From an idea to a software project: DIY store</h2>

</div>
<p>
    Let's see how each one-pager section can be filled in using the example of a feature for an online DIY store 
    (the theme used in the post can be downloaded at 
    <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/handmade-shop-wordpress-woocommerce-theme/13307231" target="_blank">themeforest.net</a>). 
    So, imagine that your goal is to increase profits in the next half year by 15%. After the brainstorming, among 
    the many ideas was a suggestion to remind customers of products that were about to run out in order to 
    encourage repeat purchases.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
    Often, analysis summaries that make it easier to assess the impact of a potential project are available 
    before you start planning. Make sure you know where to find them and have time to familiarize yourself with 
    them beforehand.
</p>
<h3>Project Name, Author, and Stakeholders</h3>
<p>
    A well-chosen name helps to catch the idea of the project from the first seconds and win the attention of 
    stakeholders. When choosing a name, try to pick the one that would be the most familiar to a wide audience: 
    it'll be quite difficult to pitch the project if the name is far too vague or contains highly specialized 
    terminology. Try to reflect the key idea instead of dwelling on a concept that can be understood in various 
    ways. Only rely on using acronyms or fancy names if you are sure that all stakeholders are able to get what 
    you are talking about. The purpose of this document is to present what the project offers,  you can always 
    come up with a cool name later.
</p>
<p>
    It's worth specifying the author of the idea to receive feedback from people that weren't able to participate 
    in an idea presentation session. Also. it'll allow stakeholders to reach out to the right person if they want 
    to give the idea the green light. A team name helps to avoid confusion if there are similar projects in the 
    organization. If the company is small. Just a name might be enough, but to make the communication smoother 
    it's always good to leave contact info (email, group name in slack, etc.). Especially it's handy in companies 
    that give employees flexibility in editing profile names and picking messager nicknames or email addresses. 
</p>
<p>
    Stakeholders are optional but can be useful when those who make go/no-go decisions about the project are 
    not members of the team and you want to be sure that the project will be in their field of vision.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-secondary">
    <b class="alert-heading">Example</b><br/><br/>
    <i>Project Name:</i> Personalised “Buy again” reminder for ending soon goods<br/>
    <i>Author:</i> John Doe (@johndoe) / Customer Behavior Team<br/>
    <i>Stakeholders:</i> Sales Org (#sales)<br/><br/>
    The words "Personalised" and "reminder" give an idea of the implementation details, "Buy again" and 
    "ending soon" specify which product groups are involved in the project.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    Along with the name, the summary allows your stakeholders to quickly assess the potential of the project. 
    Most often, those who make a final decision don't have much time to study in detail the implementation of 
    each potential idea, and sometimes they are only interested in the impact reflected in key metrics. As 
    Tanya Reilly rightly points the way in her book 
    <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/" target="_blank">The Staff Engineer's Path</a> :
    <span class="quote mt-4 mb-4 pl-5 pr-5">"if yoo can’t convince them in 50 words, you may not be able to convince them at all"</span> 
I prefer to fill in the summary at the end, as I can put specific 
    numbers I was able to collect from other sections. To check the quality of the summary, try to highlight 
    in bold key phrases that you think should catch the eye of the reader. If there are more than half of such 
    phrases, you are on the right track.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-secondary">
    <b class="alert-heading">Example</b><br/><br/>
    <i>Summary:</i> Personalised reminders to buy again ending soon goods can increase the monthly average 
    transaction volume by 12.8% and D28 retention by 3% for web and 5.5% for mobile users. The solution is a 
    combination of mailing campaigns, push notifications, and reminding components placed in the UI. Personalised 
    recommendations and reminder settings are based on the internal solution for analysing customer behavior. 
    An MVP version can be delivered in 1 month, the complete solution required 4 months.<br/><br/>

    Here we're highlighting a few things:<br/>
    <span>- the changes in key metrics(transaction volume, retention) that are of interest to the stakeholders</span><br/>
    <span>- planned delivery time that is of interest to management</span><br/>
    <span>- a high-level solution to distinguish this idea from others</span>
