<p>
    Roadmap and project prioritization are fundamental stages in IT development. Which innovations are introduced 
    first determines the attractiveness of the product for customers and their competitiveness.
</p>
<p>
    Often teams get lost when it comes time to select the most impactful idea, especially when the planning horizon is longer than 3 
    months and the product has not yet taken a strong shape or has found market fit. And while the main burden of 
    decision-making lies with the product team, engineers can also contribute to planning to make it more 
    predictable and efficient.
</p>
<p>
    One of the best tricks I've been using in my practice is preparing a one-pager for a project idea or feature. 
    The idea of creating a one-pages appeared in a business context when companies tried to present their business 
    proposal in a sharp and focused way, usually trying to fit everything on an A4 page. In engineering, the same 
    approach applies: in a short document, state the key values of the idea that will achieve the company's goals.
</p>
<p>
    The one-pager should be done after you have decided on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" target="_blank">OKRs</a> for your team or organisation and already 
    collected ideas in the longlist.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <b class="alert-heading">Red flag</b><br/>
    if you first define projects and then tailor OKRs to them you run the risk of missing out on market expectations, falling behind competitors, and in the worst case, losing customers. 
    Without mature engineering processes, roadmapping will be inefficient as you will have to take on unplanned 
    projects without being able to prepare a good system design and thereby increasing tech debt.
</p>
<p>
    One-pager is not expected to provide deep edge case analysis or detailed system design, so preparing and 
    writing it shouldn't take much time. For example, one of my teams used to set a limit of 3 days for cross-team projects in 
    order to have time to discuss details with developers from other teams. A good one-pager only contains the 
    sections that play a key role in making a go/no-go decision. I use a simple template that is easy to apply 
    both to product and purely technical improvements (e.g. configuring monitoring for legacy systems).
</p>
<p class="font-italic">
    <b>Bonus:</b> The <a href="https://github.com/Tan--Tan/one-pager" target="_blank">template</a> of the one-pager we’re going to discuss is available in .docx and .md formats 
    so you can apply it to your ideas immediately.

    Let's see how each one-pager section can be filled in using the example of a feature for an online DIY store 
    (the theme used in the post can be downloaded at 
    <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/handmade-shop-wordpress-woocommerce-theme/13307231" target="_blank">themeforest.net</a>). 
    So, imagine that your goal is to increase profits in the next half year by 15%. After the brainstorming, among 
    the many ideas was a suggestion to remind customers of products that were about to run out in order to 
    encourage repeat purchases.

    Often, analysis summaries that make it easier to assess the impact of a potential project are available 
    before you start planning. Make sure you know where to find them and have time to familiarize yourself with 
    them beforehand.

        <b>Project Name:</b> Personalised “Buy again” reminder for ending soon goods<br/>
        <b>Author:</b> Tatsiana Mihai (@tmihai) / Customer Behavior Team<br/>
        <b>Stakeholders:</b> Sales Org (#sales)<br/>
        <b>Summary:</b> Personalised reminders to buy again ending soon goods can increase the monthly average 
        transaction volume by 12.8% and D28 retention by 3% for web and 5.5% for mobile users. The solution is a 
        combination of mailing campaigns, push notifications, and reminding components placed in the UI. Personalised 
        recommendations and reminder settings are based on the internal solution for analysing customer behavior. 
        An MVP version can be delivered in 1 month, the complete solution required 4 months.<br/>
        <b>Problem:</b> After reviewing sales data for the past 3 months, it was found that 48% of regular customers make repeat purchases 
        of low and mid-price products. However, only 12% of them return as soon as the necessary materials end, while the rest purchase 
        with a delay of 2 weeks to 2 months.<br/>
        <b>Impact:</b> The reminders will increase the number of timely purchases by 1.2% through mailing, 2.3% through mobile 
        notifications, and 6.5% through in-app experience, amounting to $546K annually. Additionally, we anticipate growing user 
        acquisition by  3.2% within 6 months, implying an additional profit of $120-$160K.<br/>

</div>
<p>And now, let's make a deep dive into each section.</p>
<h3>Project Name, Author, and Stakeholders</h3>
<p>
    A well-chosen name helps to catch the idea of the project from the first seconds and win the attention of 
    stakeholders. When choosing a name, try to pick the one that would be the most familiar to a wide audience: 
    it'll be quite difficult to pitch the project if the name is far too vague or contains highly specialized 
    terminology. Try to reflect the key idea instead of dwelling on a concept that can be understood in various 
    ways. Only rely on using acronyms or fancy names if you are sure that all stakeholders are able to get what 
    you are talking about. The purpose of this document is to present what the project offers,  you can always 
    come up with a cool name later.
</p>
<p>
    It's worth specifying the author of the idea to receive feedback from people that weren't able to participate 
    in an idea presentation session. Also. it'll allow stakeholders to reach out to the right person if they want 
    to give the idea the green light. A team name helps to avoid confusion if there are similar projects in the 
    organization. If the company is small. Just a name might be enough, but to make the communication smoother 
    it's always good to leave contact info (email, group name in slack, etc.). Especially it's handy in companies 
    that give employees flexibility in editing profile names and picking messager nicknames or email addresses. 
</p>
<p>
    Stakeholders are optional but can be useful when those who make go/no-go decisions about the project are 
    not members of the team and you want to be sure that the project will be in their field of vision.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-secondary">
    <b class="alert-heading">Check the Example <a href="#example">&uarr;</a></b><br/>
    The words "Personalised" and "reminder" give an idea of the implementation details, "Buy again" and 
    "ending soon" specify which product groups are involved in the project.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    Along with the name, the summary allows your stakeholders to quickly assess the potential of the project. 
    Most often, those who make a final decision don't have much time to study in detail the implementation of 
    each potential idea, and sometimes they are only interested in the impact reflected in key metrics. As 
    Tanya Reilly rightly points the way in her book 
    <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/" target="_blank">The Staff Engineer's Path</a> :
    <span class="quote mt-4 mb-4 pl-5 pr-5">"if you can’t convince them in 50 words, you may not be able to convince them at all"</span> 
I prefer to fill in the summary at the end, as I can put specific 
    numbers I was able to collect from other sections. To check the quality of the summary, try to highlight 
    in bold key phrases that you think should catch the eye of the reader. If there are more than half of such 
    phrases, you are on the right track.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-secondary">
    <b class="alert-heading">Check the Example <a href="#example">&uarr;</a></b><br/>
    Here we're highlighting a few things:<br/>
    <span>- the changes in key metrics(transaction volume, retention) that are of interest to the stakeholders</span><br/>
    <span>- planned delivery time that is of interest to management</span><br/>
    <span>- a high-level solution to distinguish this idea from others</span>
</p>
<h3>Problem and Impact</h3>
<p>
    Perhaps the key section for stakeholders. The project must either solve a serious problem, or bring enormous benefit, or better both. 
    But how to understand the size of the problem or impact? This is where analytical data and monitoring data come handy and this is 
    how the tedious work of properly configuring them pays off.
</p>
<p>
    Monitoring is better suited to assess the technical condition of the product: how resistant it is to failures, how it copes 
    with peak loads. From such data, it is usually possible to calculate the potential and actual financial losses in the event of a 
    service failure. During the analysis, interesting data can come out about cost overruns on excessive infrastructure, unexpected 
    memory leaks, or double charges for using 3P services. The impact for such metrics is to reduce financial costs, improve 
    performance, and accelerate development speed. Quite often such improvements are hidden under the hood of the product, which may 
    create some obstacles for the approval by the product manager.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <b class="alert-heading">Red flag</b><br/>
    Stay skeptical when choosing refactoring or projects about replacing tech stack. If you can't prove in numbers that swapping one 
    code for another will improve some metrics, it's likely that the project is guess based, underperforming, and should be re-evaluated.
</p>
<p>
    Analytical data is a storehouse of ideas for product improvement. By conducting various 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/qualitative-quantitative-research/">quantitative and qualitative experiments 
    with data</a>, you can find interesting patterns and validate hypotheses before actual development begins. Quantitative data 
    includes raw and aggregated data generated by the product (data on transactions, the number of active users, etc.). They help 
    you evaluate the potential of your idea in terms of current business performance and existing audience, as well as take into 
    account the costs and risks that can be inferred from degrading metrics. This data lives either in your databases or in global 
    reporting storage. If your company does not have a team responsible for post-collection data analysis, arrange with management 
    for a self-analysis time before roadmapping begins.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
    <b class="alert-heading">Good to know</b><br/>
    In the case of evaluating a new product that does not yet have actual historical data, one pager can use the search for data 
    or attacks of companies running repetitive projects that can be found in the access operation.
</p>
<p>
    Equally important are the qualitative product measurements. These include surveys, user interviews, prototype testing, product 
    Persona creation, etc. You are unlikely to get fundamental impact changes from this data, but you can generate more hypotheses 
    to validate. In addition, qualitative data provides more insights to understand user expectations better and improve the customer 
    experience.
</p>
<p>
    When choosing an idea based on data, always remember the OKRa. As groundbreaking as your project is to increase the number of 
    new users, it's of little use for the OKR aimed at increasing sales. If the idea seems significant but goes against the team's 
    goals, put it aside until better times or try to find a team whose OKRs are more suitable. However, suppose the project targets 
    both the primary metric and improves some other one. In that case, it's worth reflecting all of them in the Impact section as 
    it affects the project's total value and might be decisive in the last shortlisting stage.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <b class="alert-heading">Red Flag</b><br/>
    While exploring metrics and choosing an idea, it's easy to enter a state of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis" target="_blank">analysis paralysis</a> 
    and start overthinking. There are different ways to avoid it, and limiting the time for preparing the one-pager is one of them.
</p>
<p>
    It'll be a plus to indicate either in the Problem or in the Impact section how exactly the project will change the metrics in case 
    of success in quantitative terms, as well as how long it'll take to achieve it. Long-term projects (2+ years) are best broken 
    down into shorter periods (3-6 months) with defined success criteria for each so that you can reduce risks and drop the project 
    if it underperforms.
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
    The most familiar and expected section for engineers, as here, we want to see how the idea will be brought to life in detail. 
    However, it's worth remembering that the purpose of the one-pager is to give only those details that will influence the decision 
    regarding the project. Time is limited for writing and reviewing one-pagers, so instead of detailed diagrams and database schema 
    designing, focus on showing changes in significant system components. This way, you will avoid discussions about implementation 
    details that aren't important at this stage. You can create a separate document and link to it in the Useful Links section for 
    code examples and listing all dependent services. The same rule applies when the solution involves data analysis or launching
    marketing campaigns, where code changes are minimal - only key hypotheses and strategies are included.
</p>
<p>
    If several implementation options are equally well suited to solving a problem, try to evaluate them in terms of effort/value 
    ratio and pick the best option. If such an assessment requires additional research, benchmarking, or a long review, add this 
    stage to the Milestones section and indicate in the Risks what problems will arise if the wrong choice is made and how they 
    should be minimised.
</p>
<p>
    If your idea involves visual changes (for example, a new element in the user interface), it is better to sketch a prototype, 
    as one image will replace several paragraphs of the description and give maximum context to the reviewers. For less visible changes, 
    like infrastructure projects, you can draw a component diagram, abstracting away the low-level details.
</p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/2023-07-06/fail-fast.png" />
</div>
<p>
    This section is optional at this stage because sometimes it's problematic to complete it with the level of detail you've had so far. 
    To give the most accurate evaluations, one must be more or less sure of the solution, and we remember from the previous section 
    that they are often unknown. However, if you can sketch out essential parts at least at a high level, you will greatly improve the 
    quality of your one-pager and enable reviewers to make an informed decision about the project.
</p>
<p>
    As an added bonus, you get a clearer understanding of the project's chances of success. Often what seems like a small 
    one-month-one-person project, when broken down into more specific parts, turns into a quarterly assignment for the entire team. 
    This exercise also clarifies whether all the necessary roles are currently presented in the company and have capacity to support 
    the project.
</p>
<p>
    As well as, with the Solution, you shouldn't describe what needs to be done task by task. Stakeholders are interested in data about 
    when the project can expect the first results, and think about how best to distribute work to deliver (or fall) quickly.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">
    <b class="alert-heading">Good to know</b><br/>
    Make sure you collect all the necessary metrics to track project dynamics. Add the very first milestone to set up monitoring 
    if metrics are not being collected.
</p>
<p>
    If your company already uses some planning tool, you can replace the table in the template with any other format, like Gantt Chart 
    or Miro Board. The main thing is to make it easy to understand how much time and people it takes to complete each stage.
</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>
    There are no projects without risks. However, they often reveal themselves only when development has begun and there's 
    little time to find a good solution. But it's also impossible to know all the possible risks in advance. What is this section for, 
    then? At this stage, it's essential to know if there's a way for you to get out of a difficult situation and still achieve 
    your original goals.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes in this section, together with the Milestones, it becomes evident that the project cost is too high. Various factors, 
    such as external regulators, business seasonality, or internal company policies, significantly affect a project's success and 
    cannot always be influenced. For example, you want to do some cool upgrades to increase sales, but game-changing changes won't 
    be ready until mid-November, the busiest business season. And if you can't get around this risk, the project will be put on hold 
    until better times.
</p>
<p>
    Problems like team inexperience or failed past launches also increase the risk of project success. Following a blameless culture 
    without specifying names, titles, or teams is essential when filling out such concerns. The one-pager is a public document and 
    shouldn't create an environment for an improper perception.
</p>
<p>
    Risk levels and mitigation strategies must be realistic and achievable. Here, as well as with metrics, if you can't provide a plan 
    to solve or at least minimise the problem outcome, you risk not only blocking the current project for an indeterminate time but 
    also worsening the performance of active services and, most likely, increasing tech debt.

    It's best to limit the list of risks to factors within the team's control. There is no need to enumerate factors like a 
    reorganization or change of direction of the company: usually, when there are such big pivots, everything will be re-prioritized, 
    and all mitigation plans will be irrelevant.

        As you can see, the risk directly associated with the impact is rated High, and the measures to prevent the consequences aim 
        to reduce the negative effect - do not involve all users, monitor if they turn off the function. At a time when less significant 
        problems are solved by relying on internal resources (e.g., 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank">dogfooding</a>) or additional tests.

<h3>Useful Links</h3>
<p>
    Of course, links can be placed directly in the text, but there is a risk of diverting reviewers from the information focused on 
    the one-pager to less important details. Put here all the external and internal resources you used to prepare the document. 
    It's worth adding a detailed title to each link so that if the information is no longer available (for example, the logs can 
    be moved after the retention period to another storage), at least the context will be preserved.
