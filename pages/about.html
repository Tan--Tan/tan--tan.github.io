    Hi and welcome to my personal blog. My name is Tatsiana Mihai and I’ve been passionate about software 
    engineering since I developed my first website at 13. I’ve decided to start this blog to share with you 
    interesting cases, practices, and just funny stories about engineering which I’ve been collecting for 
    more than 10 years. I’m originally from Belarus but now I’m a Staff Engineer at Tractable based in the UK. 
    When I’m AFK you can find me baking, reading tech and non-tech books, or taking a long walk. I’ll be happy 
    to stay in touch so feel free to contact me via social networks or email.
</p>

This page is still in progress as I’ve never been strong in speaking of myself. I’ll keep updating it with more 
information about my background, experience, and personal info.
